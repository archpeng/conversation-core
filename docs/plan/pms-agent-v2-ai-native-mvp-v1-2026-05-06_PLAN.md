# PMS Agent V2 AI-Native MVP PLAN

Plan ID: `pms-agent-v2-ai-native-mvp-v1-2026-05-06`
Status: `ACTIVE`
Mode: `single-root-autopilot-compatible`
Source roadmap: `docs/roadmap/ai-native-pms-agent-monorepo-roadmap.md`

## Objective

Create a minimal, clean `pms-agent-v2` monorepo that proves this thesis:

```text
Strong pi-coding-agent Agent Core
+ Safety Gateway
+ gated capabilities
+ PMS evidence grounding
+ proposal/approval-first high-risk actions
+ audit/eval proof
= safe AI-native PMS Agent MVP
```

## Scope

In scope:

1. New monorepo bootstrap and no-legacy guardrails.
2. `FeishuTurnInput -> AgentResult` external contract.
3. Safety Gateway capability/risk/constraint/audit kernel.
4. Gated tool runner and minimal gated tools.
5. Typed `pms-platform` client with evidence envelopes.
6. `pi-coding-agent` unified runtime with minimal redacted session continuity.
7. `agent-service` HTTP API.
8. `adapter-feishu` alignment to the new contract.
9. Customer PMS read and reservation prepare-confirm loop.
10. Admin proposal workspace loop.
11. Sandbox bash/read/write/edit hardening.
12. Audit/eval hardening and end-to-end closeout.

Out of scope:

1. Production replacement of `ai-conversation`.
2. Old `ai-conversation` response compatibility in `pms-agent-v2`.
3. Generic HTTP broker or arbitrary endpoint execution.
4. Generic plugin/extension marketplace.
5. Multi-agent supervisor or complex workflow engine.
6. Long-term memory or cross-tenant learning.
7. Full PMS workflow coverage or production skill publishing.

## Architecture Laws

1. Agent understands and plans; it does not own permission, PMS truth, or final mutation authority.
2. Safety Gateway decides capability allow/deny/approval/rewrite before every executor.
3. PMS Platform owns PMS facts, workflow state, pending action, idempotency, and mutation truth.
4. Proposal workspace carries change artifacts; production registries are not writable in MVP.
5. Audit/Eval prove behavior and catch regressions; they do not replace runtime authorization.
6. Prompt stays short; policy lives in code.
7. Review acceptance requires removal of all redundant, compatibility, dead, unused, and explanatory-comment clutter created by the slice.

## Stage Definitions

#### `P0` — bootstrap-clean-monorepo

- Owner: `execute-plan`
- State: `DONE`
- Priority: `critical`

目标：

- Create the new `pms-agent-v2` repo/workspace skeleton with minimal TypeScript tooling and hard no-legacy guardrails.

交付物：

1. `pms-agent-v2` workspace with `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `tsconfig.base.json`, minimal build/test scripts, and package folders.
2. Root docs: `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SAFETY.md` carrying the no-compatibility laws.
3. Boundary guard script/test proving no `ai-conversation` dependency, no `ai-pms` fallback, no `pi-agent-core` hot path, and no V1/V2 compatibility module.
4. Minimal smoke test proving repo test runner works.

验证：

1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpm build`
3. `pnpm test`
4. boundary guard script/test passes.

review_cleanup：

1. Delete scaffold comments, placeholder files, unused exports, generated example code, and any compatibility wording that weakens the no-legacy law.

done_when:

1. New repo builds and tests with only minimal scaffold code.
2. No planned package is missing.
3. Guardrails fail on banned legacy strings/imports where appropriate.
4. Root docs explicitly state `pi-coding-agent` first and Safety Gateway only boundary.

stop_boundary:

1. Stop if the target repo location is ambiguous.
2. Stop if tooling requires broad framework choices not needed for build/test.
3. Stop if any bootstrap path introduces old `ai-conversation` runtime compatibility.

必须避免：

1. Do not implement business logic in P0.
2. Do not add plugin systems, generic routers, database layers, or production deployment files.

#### `P1` — adapter-contracts-only

4. Contract tests for valid and invalid inputs/outputs.

验证：

1. Contract package tests pass.
2. Full repo `pnpm test` passes.
3. Static guard rejects old `replies[]` contract in `pms-agent-v2` runtime surfaces.

1. Remove unused schema helpers, overly generic validators, old-shape adapters, and explanatory comments that duplicate type names.

done_when:

1. Valid `FeishuTurnInput` and all `AgentResult` variants validate.
2. Invalid actor, missing tenant/session/message fields, and empty message are rejected.
3. Old `ai-conversation` response shape is not accepted by `pms-agent-v2`.

stop_boundary:

1. Stop if adapter contract tries to expose Agent trace, Safety Gateway internals, or pi-coding-agent internals.
2. Stop if implementing compatibility becomes necessary to pass tests; replan the adapter slice instead.

必须避免：

1. Do not add internal runtime fields to the external contract.
2. Do not create generic channel abstractions.

#### `P1A` — upstream-downstream-alignment

- Owner: `execute-plan`

交付物：

1. In `adapter-feishu`, a minimal new turn-forwarding path mapping `InboundTurn -> FeishuTurnInput`.
2. In `adapter-feishu`, a minimal `AgentResult -> Feishu delivery` mapper for text, refusal, proposal, and PMS approval card.
3. New env names or bounded config path for `PMS_AGENT_TURN_URL` / auth token, without requiring `pms-agent-v2` to speak old `AI_CONVERSATION` response shape.
4. A documented endpoint map from `pms-agent-v2` client methods to current `pms-platform` routes.

验证：

1. `adapter-feishu` tests for request mapping and AgentResult delivery pass.
2. Existing typed-card callback tests still pass.
3. No `pms-platform` code changes unless a typed endpoint gap is proven.

review_cleanup：

1. Delete temporary old/new dual mappers if the new path replaces them in the touched surface.
2. Remove stale comments mentioning compatibility as a runtime goal.

done_when:

1. Adapter can call `/v1/feishu-turn` with `FeishuTurnInput`.
2. Adapter can deliver all MVP `AgentResult` variants.
3. Existing `adapter-feishu -> pms-platform` typed-card callback remains intact.
4. `pms-agent-v2` still has no old `replies[]` response support.

stop_boundary:

1. Stop if adapter change would require broad provider architecture rewrite.
2. Stop if callback ownership becomes ambiguous between `adapter-feishu` and `pms-agent-v2`.
3. Stop if `pms-platform` lacks a required typed route; document gap instead of adding generic HTTP.

必须避免：

1. Do not make `pms-agent-v2` compatible with old adapter response expectations.

done_when:

1. Pack is terminal and no active implementation/review work remains.

stop_boundary:

1. If any non-terminal slice remains active, hand back to that slice; do not close out.

必须避免：

1. Do not use closeout to skip review or cleanup.

## Continuous Wave Ladder

```text
P0 -> P1 -> P1A -> P2 -> P3 -> P4 -> P5 -> P6 -> P7 -> P8 -> P9 -> P10 -> P11 -> P12 -> PACK_COMPLETE
```

Each stage follows:

```text
wave_plan -> execute -> review -> accepted-writeback -> next stage
```

Review acceptance is the only normal advancement point. Execute completion is not terminal.

## Global Validation Ladder

1. Per-package unit tests after each slice.
2. Boundary/static guard after any contract/tool/runtime change.
3. `pnpm build` and `pnpm test` for `pms-agent-v2` after each implementation slice.
4. `adapter-feishu npm test` after adapter alignment changes.
5. `pms-platform npm test` only if platform is touched; otherwise use existing endpoint contract evidence.
6. `pnpm eval` from P10 onward and after any Safety Gateway / Agent / tool prompt change.
7. `git diff --check` in every touched repo before review acceptance.

## Hard Closeout Guard

Closeout is forbidden unless:

1. `docs/plan/README.md` current active slice is `PACK_COMPLETE`.
2. `WORKSET` active stage is `PACK_COMPLETE`.
3. `STATUS` active step is `PACK_COMPLETE`.
4. `P12` accepted review evidence exists.
5. No non-deferred stage remains incomplete.
